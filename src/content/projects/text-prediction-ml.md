A capstone project that built a complete text prediction application using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The application processes large text corpora, builds predictive models, and provides real-time text prediction through an interactive Shiny interface.

## Approach

The project involved data collection and preprocessing of large text datasets, feature engineering for n-gram models, model training and evaluation, and deployment as a production-ready Shiny application. The focus was on creating a practical, usable tool that demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline from data to deployment.

## Technical Details

- Natural language processing for text preprocessing
- N-gram modeling for sequence prediction
- Model optimization and evaluation
- Interactive Shiny application deployment
- User interface design for real-time prediction

This project showcases the full lifecycle of an ML application, from data preparation through model development to user-facing deployment.
