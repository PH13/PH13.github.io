A collection of interactive data visualizations built with D3.js to explore patterns in demographics, population data, and sports analytics. These projects demonstrate the power of interactive visualization for exploratory analysis and communicating insights.

## Projects

- **DC Demographics**: Interactive visualization exploring demographic patterns across Washington, D.C.
- **Wizards Scoring**: Analysis of Washington Wizards scoring patterns and game performance
- **Virginia Demographics**: Interactive map and charts exploring demographic data across Virginia counties

Each visualization uses D3.js to create responsive, interactive experiences that allow users to explore the data dynamically. The focus is on making complex datasets accessible and discoverable through thoughtful design and interaction patterns.
