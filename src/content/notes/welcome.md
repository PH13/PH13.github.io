This is a space for notes on data engineering, AI/ML, quantitative methods, and analytics. Future entries will cover design decisions, experiments, and short write-ups related to data and analytics work.

## Writing Sample

I've also written technical reports for business and strategic planning contexts. For example, I prepared a report on drones and their applications for electric cooperatives for the Business Development and Strategies Department at the [National Rural Electric Cooperative Association](http://www.nreca.coop/). This work demonstrates the ability to translate technical concepts into actionable business insights.
