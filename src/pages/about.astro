          I graduated in December 2015 from <a href="https://www.vt.edu/index.html" class="text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300 underline">Virginia Tech</a> with a Bachelor of Science in <a href="http://www.ise.vt.edu/" class="text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300 underline">Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> and a minor in Business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" class="text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300 underline">Data Science Specialization</a> through Coursera and Johns Hopkins, which provided a strong foundation in statistical methods, machine learning, and data visualization.

          My work focuses on building systems that turn data into actionable insights. I approach problems with a systems-first mindset, emphasizing reliability, observability, and clear communication with stakeholders. Whether it's designing data pipelines, developing ML models, or building analytics dashboards, I prioritize solutions that are maintainable, scalable, and aligned with business or mission objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm based in Northern Virginia and work on projects spanning data engineering, AI/ML pipelines, quantitative modeling, and government contracting analytics.
