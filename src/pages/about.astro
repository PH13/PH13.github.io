        <p>
          I am a systems-minded data engineer and quant-oriented analyst who builds AI pipelines, cloud data systems, and simulation-driven analytics tools that support decision-making in high-impact environments. My background combines systems engineering, quantitative modeling, and applied data science with hands-on experience developing products, dashboards, and automated workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a Master's degree in Systems Engineering from <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/" class="text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300 underline">George Mason University</a> and a Bachelor's in Industrial & Systems Engineering from <a href="https://www.vt.edu/index.html" class="text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300 underline">Virginia Tech</a>. Early in my career, I worked in DoD fuel logistics and government contracting, where I learned to design processes, analyze complex operational systems, and deliver reliable solutions under real constraints. More recently, I served as a Senior Data Analyst at the National Association of Home Builders, where I built large-scale analytics pipelines and dashboards for 114,000 members across 700+ local associations, including retention modeling, segmentation, visualization systems, and monthly engagement reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across every role, my focus has been consistent: build systems that make data useful. I work end-to-end across the stack—from ingestion and ETL, to modeling and feature engineering, to dashboarding and deployment. I use Python, SQL, modern cloud tooling (AWS S3, Redshift, Glue), and visualization frameworks like D3.js and Tableau Public. I also work extensively with AI/ML models: building text-analysis tools, embedding-based retrieval systems, Monte Carlo simulations, forecasting pipelines, and automated content-generation workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm especially energized by the intersection of AI, quantitative methods, and data infrastructure. Whether it's automating a multi-stage AI pipeline, designing a cloud-native ETL system, or constructing a stochastic simulation model, I enjoy solving problems that require both technical depth and systems-level reasoning.

        <p>
          I'm always interested in opportunities where I can contribute to AI engineering, data engineering, quant analytics, or mission-driven technical work—especially in environments that value clarity of thought, clean architecture, and well-designed data systems.
